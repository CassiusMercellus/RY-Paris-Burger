            This is not the aspirational fluff of Instagram wall noon; it's fact. Recent
            surveys have shown that a majority of travelers consider food first 
            when planning a trip, even ahead of where they sleep. Add to this that people are
            also traveling more than ever before - earthlings logged a record-breaking 1.4 billion
            international trips last year - and it's safe to say that the hunger for new cullinary
            experiences is more ravenous than ever.

            While the endlessly alluring bistros of Paris, izakayas of Tokyo, shawarma stands of 
            Tel Aviv, and tasting menus of Mexico City will always top many of people's lists
            of cravings, we're continually on the lookout for something new to fill our bellies,
            our passports, and our feeds
